         * can chain the methods together to create the _Card object. Also I decided to go with the fluent design, 
         * rather than other alternative designs such as having a constructor with many parameters.
         * Added benefits: These set methods also allow me to add protective code when making assignments if and when needed.
         * Also please note the method parameters start with an underscore, I did this as a simple way to prevent a group of bugs
         * where I might set the class variable to itself, Also a fun note: my MTGA userName is Underscore :)
